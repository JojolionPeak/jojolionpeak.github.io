Howdy! My name is **Jonathan Bernal**, and my goal is to build _sleek and interactive_ webpages to provide users with a seamless experience whenever they come across my work. Growing up in **New York**, I've always been surrounded by people of many different backgrounds, which drove me to want to build websites that speak to everybody. I'm focused on **_user interactivity_**, and I'm excited to learn more skills in order to improve with web development!

Throughout the course of this project I have developed greater mastery over **_keyframes_**. **Keyframes** are the _style and design_ you want on your page during different stages in time, and they allow you to execute a **smooth transition** between those stages, giving your webpage more _life and customization_. I used **keyframes** to animate my _logo and hero_ section sliding into frame.

I found implementing the **Grid** for the projects that I have undertaken to be the most challenging requirement to fulfill. I achieved the grid by making an **unordered list** **_(ul)_** the parent container and having multiple **list items** **_(li)_** as flexbox containers to be the grid items. The list items consisted of _all the projects I've done, with multiple other elements to describe them_.

At multiple stages of the creation process, I was stuck trying to figure out _how to make my vision come to life_. Whenever I struggle to implement a styling choice, I go to **Claude AI** and I ask for it to help me. Sometimes I ask it to show me how to **debug my code**, but most of the time, I'm asking it to _explain a concept that I'm not grasping_ in order for me to implement it in my project.
