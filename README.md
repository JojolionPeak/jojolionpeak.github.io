Howdy! My name is **Jonathan Bernal**, and my goal is to build _sleek and interactive_ webpages to provide users with a seamless experience whenever they come across my work. Growing up in **New York**, I've always been surrounded by people of many different backgrounds, which drove me to want to build websites that speak to everybody. I'm focused on **_user interactivity_**, and I'm excited to learn more skills in order to improve with web development!
